# CS 132 Website

## Developing

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

Everything inside `src/lib` is part of your library (kindly put components here), everything inside `src/routes` is where the primary pages are.

## Building

To create a production version of your showcase app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```
